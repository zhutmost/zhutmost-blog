Analog support multiple analytics systems. With them, you can easily track your blog's performance and user behavior.
The following analytics systems are provided by [timlrx/pliny](https://github.com/timlrx/pliny). Please refer to its README for a complete list of supported plugins and their configuration details.

Now, let's demonstrate how to set up an analytics system using [Umami](https://umami.is) as an example.

## Umami

1. Log in [Umami](https://umami.is). Click the "Add website" button on the "Websites" page, and fill the form with your blog's information such as name and homepage URL. Click "Save" to complete site creation.
  ![Umami Add Website](umami-add-website.png "Add website information on Umami")
2. On the next page, find the "Website ID" (a very long string), and set it as the value of `analytics -> umamiAnalytics -> umamiWebsiteId` in the  user configuration file `/data/site-config.ts`.
  ![Umami Website ID](umami-website-id.png "Find the Website ID on Umami")

If you have completed the above steps, your configuration file should look like this:

```typescript
analytics: {
  umamiAnalytics: {
    umamiWebsiteId: '4ae5ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP-QRSTUVWb927e',
  },
},
```

Now, Umami will track your blog's traffic. You can view the statistics on the Umami dashboard.

### Add a Icon to the Footer

To make it easier for visitors to access the analytics, you can add an icon link to the footer.

Umami provides a "shard link" on the "Websites" page. You may need to enable it first.

![Umami Share Link](umami-share-link.png "Find the Share Link on Umami")

You can add the above URL with a Tabler icon in the user configuration file `/data/site-config.ts`, like this:

```typescript {4-7} showLineNumbers=1
footer: {
  icons: {
    ...,
    Analytics: {
      icon: 'IconChartDots',
      href: 'https://cloud.umami.is/share/unndABCDEFGHIJys/your-site.com',
    },
  },
},
```

Then, you can see the analytics icon in the footer of your blog (like this demo site).
