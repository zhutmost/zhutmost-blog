Analog is based on many open source frameworks and tools. Here is a list of the main tools used in Analog:

## Basics

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) + [React](https://react.dev) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) constitute the main tech stack of Analog. The main reason for choosing them is simply because I initially referred to a excellent blog template - [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). Of course, the fact that these frameworks are popular is also a key reason - I can easily obtain information for reference.
- [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev) is used to convert MDX files (including `posts` and `about`) into HTMLs. It can be well integrated with Rehype and Remark plugins, thus achieving functions such as syntax highlighting and ToC extraction. A similar tool, [ContentLayer](https://contentlayer.dev/docs), is currently not actively maintained, so I chose to migrate to Content Collections.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is used to deploy this demo blog. Of course, you can also deploy it to other platforms, such as GitHub Pages.

## Writing

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is used to write posts. It is a combination of Markdown and JSX, which can be easily integrated with React components. In most cases, it is a superset of Markdown, so there is usually no need to worry about syntax compatibility issues during migration (except for changing the file extension from `.md` to `.mdx`).

### Rehype & Remark Plugins

- The mathematical formula environment is supported by Katex (via [rehype-katex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex) and [remark-math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math)).
- Code syntax highlighting is supported by highlighting.js (via [rehype-highlight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-highlight)). [rehype-highlight-code-lines](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-highlight-code-lines) can be used to highlight specific lines of code.
- [rehype-probe-image-size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-probe-image-size) can automatically obtain the image sizes and add them to the `<img>` tags as attributes. A explicit width and height are required by the [Next.js Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image). [rehype-unwrap-images](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-unwrap-images) can remove the `<p>` tags that wrap the `<img>` tags.
- [remark-gfm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-gfm) and [remark-github-blockquote-alert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-github-blockquote-alert) are used to support GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).

## Style

- The icons are provided by [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons). Emojis come from [Twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji).
- [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js) is a typing animation library that is used to generate the scrolled greeting text on the home page.
- [shadncn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) is a UI library that provides a variety of components and styles. I used a few basic components (with some modifications), including buttons and avatars. They are stored in the `@/component/ui` folder.
- [tw-colors](https://github.com/L-Blondy/tw-colors) is used to generate two color schemes for the light and dark modes. With it, I no longer need to specify the color scheme for the dark mode using a cumbersome class name syntax (like `text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-300`).

## Miscellaneous

- [timlrx/pliny](https://github.com/timlrx/pliny) provides analytics and comment systems. The KBar search component is also modified from it.
- The built-in search function is provided by [KBar](https://kbar.vercel.app). It supports `Cmd+K` shortcuts and can search for both pages and posts.
- [feed](https://github.com/jpmonette/feed) is used to generate the RSS feed.

## Inspiration

At the beginning of the implementation, I referenced the look and style of [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). But as development progressed, I basically reimplemented all the needed components from scratch. I was a Hexo user before, so I also drew inspiration from [ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus).

The greeting part on the home page refers to [Karhdo's Blog](https://karhdo.dev) and [thetalhatahir.com](https://www.thetalhatahir.com).

The image placeholders (i.e., post banners) are generated by [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos).

Thanks to all the open source projects and developers who have contributed to the above tools and resources.
