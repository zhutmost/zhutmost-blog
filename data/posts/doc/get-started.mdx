Analog is a blog template based on Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Content Collections. It is designed to be simple, fast, and customizable.
This guide will introduce the basic information about Analog and help you get started with it.

## Getting Started

There has been a brief [Quick Start in README](https://github.com/zhutmost/analog-blog-starter).
This section will provide more detailed information about how to get started with Analog.

### Deploy it on the Internet

Analog is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs), a modern web application generator.
It can be deployed on various platforms, such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) (Recommended) and [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

#### Deploy with Vercel

Vercel is a popular platform supporting site deployment.

1. Click the "Deploy with Vercel" button in README (You need to sign up for a Vercel account first).
  ![Screenshot of Vercel deployment - step 1](vercel-button.png "Click the Vercel button on README")
2. Follow the instructions to deploy your blog. It will automatically fork the repository to your GitHub account.

3. Wait for the deployment to complete, and then you can access your blog at the URL provided by Vercel.

From now on, whenever you modify your website and push it to the repository, Vercel will automatically pull the update and build the deployment.

#### Deploy with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub. Analog has built-in some workflows for GitHub Pages deployment.

1. Click the "Use this template" button in the repository to create your own repository.

2. Set the GitHub Pages source `Settings -> Pages -> Build and Deployment Source` to `Actions`.

3. Enable the workflow in the Actions tab.

4. You can find your blog at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`.

After the workflow is enabled, it will automatically deploy your blog to GitHub Pages whenever you push changes to the repository.

### Deploy it Locally

If you want to preview your blog locally, you can follow these steps to temporarily deploy it on your computer.

#### Install Dependencies

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Yarn v2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) to run Analog.

On macOS:

```shell
brew install node # install node.js >= 20
corepack enable # enable corepack for yarn 2
```

If you are using Linux or Windows, you can download prebuilt binaries from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-binaries).

#### Fork and Clone it to Your Computer

After you deploy the blog on Vercel or GitHub Pages, you will have a Analog repository fork on your GitHub account.
Now, clone your repository to your computer.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/<your_repository>.git my_blog
cd my_blog
```

#### Start the Development Server

You can start the development server with the following command.

```shell
yarn install # install NPM dependencies
yarn dev # start the development server
```

Then you will see console output like this:

```
/usr/local/bin/yarn run dev
Starting content-collections content-collections.ts
build started ...
... Tag & Category count generated
... finished build of 2 collections and 13 documents in 837ms
start watching ...
  â–² Next.js 14.2.17 (turbo)
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000

 âœ“ Starting...
 âœ“ Ready in 1142ms
```

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to preview your blog.

#### Writing Your First Post

You can add a new post by creating a new MDX file in the `data/posts` directory.

```shell
cat << EOF > data/posts/hello-world.mdx
---
title: "Hello, World!"
datePublish: 2024-11-06
summary: "This is the first post of Analog."
---
I am writing my first post with Analog.
EOF
```

Then you can see the new post on the preview page.

To change the author information, you can modify the file `data/authors/default.mdx`. You can also remove the default posts and add your own posts.
Your local changes need to be pushed to your GitHub repository to deploy.
