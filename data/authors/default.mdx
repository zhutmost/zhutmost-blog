Welcome to my blog.

I am Haozhe Zhu (朱浩哲).

Currently I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Frontier Institute of Chip & System, Fudan University](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn), with [Qi Liu](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/8e/48/c22619a429640/page.htm). I am also working closely with [Chixiao Chen](https://cihlab.github.io/cxchen.html).

Most of my works lie in a overlap of integrated circuits and artificial intelligence.

## Education

- 2017-2022, Ph.D in Microelectronics and Solid-state Electronics, Fudan University, with [Xiaoyang Zeng](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288001700).
- 2013-2017, B.Eng. in Microelectronics Science & Engineering, Fudan University.
